Project template extracted from [HTML5 Shoot 'em Up in an Afternoon](https://leanpub.com/html5shootemupinanafternoon)

Based on Luke Wilde's [phaser-js-boilerplate](https://github.com/lukewilde/phaser-js-boilerplate). Please refer to the project for more information.

I've removed the `.jshintrc` so you can choose your own linting settings.
